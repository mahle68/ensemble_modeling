# ensemble_modeling
This repository includes R scripts and input data for predicting changes in the migratory route of Oriental honey-buzzards under two scenarios of climate change, using an ensemble modeling approach.
The results of this project have been published as a paper titled "Climate change alters the optimal wind-dependent flight routes of an avian migrant" accessible through http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/284/1854/20170149
