# ensemble_modeling
This repository includes scripts for predicting changes in the migratory route of Oriental honey-buzzards under two scenarios of climate change, using an ensemble modeling approach.
This repository currently includes input points (occurrence points) and the R script for carrying out the analyses.
The results of this project have been submitted to a peer reviewed journal. Upon acceptance of the manuscript, all the environmental data needed to successfully run the R script, as well as the relevant citation, will be uploaded.
